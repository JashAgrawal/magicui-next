## Project: UniChat Magic UI System

### Overview
UniChat is building a dynamic, AI-powered UI generation platform, with a focus on a component system called "Magic UI." The platform aims to enable rapid prototyping, live UI generation, and seamless integration of AI-driven UI suggestions into modern web applications.

### Goals
- Enable users to generate, preview, and integrate UI components dynamically.
- Provide a playground for experimenting with AI-generated UI.
- Support real-time feedback and regeneration of UI components.
- Ensure robust error handling and a smooth developer experience.

### Key Features
- **Magic UI Component Library**: A set of reusable, customizable UI components (buttons, cards, modals, etc.) built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- **AI-Driven UI Generation**: Integration with AI services (e.g., Gemini) to generate UI code and layouts based on user prompts or requirements.
- **Playground & Demo Pages**: Interactive pages for users to test, preview, and modify generated UIs.
- **Regeneration & Error Handling**: Ability to regenerate components and handle errors gracefully via boundaries and feedback mechanisms.
- **API Endpoints**: Backend routes to handle UI generation requests and serve dynamic content.

### User Stories
- As a developer, I want to generate UI components from natural language prompts so that I can prototype faster.
- As a user, I want to preview and interact with generated UIs before integrating them into my project.
- As a developer, I want to customize and regenerate components if the initial output does not meet my needs.
- As a team, we want robust error handling to ensure a smooth experience even when AI generation fails.

### Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS.
- **Component System**: Modular, easily extendable, and documented.
- **AI Integration**: Service layer for communicating with AI models (e.g., Gemini) for UI generation.
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for UI generation and data handling.
- **State Management**: Context API for managing Magic UI state and interactions.
- **Testing & Playground**: Example and playground pages for development and QA.

### Success Metrics
- Time to generate and preview a new UI component.
- User satisfaction with generated UIs (qualitative feedback).
- Error rate and recovery time for failed generations.
- Adoption rate of Magic UI components in user projects.

### Future Considerations
- Support for more complex layouts and multi-step UI flows.
- Integration with additional AI models and data sources.
- Export options for generated code (e.g., copy to clipboard, download as file).
- Collaboration features for teams.
